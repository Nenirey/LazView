All images
----------
ExifTool seems to specify the Thumbnail offset from image start while dExif
refers to the begin of the TIFF header; in images without an APP0 segment this
is a 12-byte difference.

Tag "ExposureTime" is written in Big-Endian format although the EXIF segment
is identified to be Little-Endian. Reading the exposure time as Big-Endian
then the value is 1/250, like in ExifTool.

The same seems to be true for "FocalLength" which shows a much more reasonable
value (4500/100 = 4.5mm) when read as BigEndian than the -0.9mm resulting from
LittleEndian. Note this is not in agreement with ExifTool.

Reading also "Flash" as BigEndian yields the value $10 = 16, which means
"Off, Did not fire".
